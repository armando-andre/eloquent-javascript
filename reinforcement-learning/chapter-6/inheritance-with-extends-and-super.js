// Create a class called Animal with a constructor that takes a name and a method called eat which prints "[name] is eating.".
// Create a new class Dog that extends Animal.
// The Dog constructor should also take a name. It must call super(name) to pass the name to the Animal constructor.
// Add a bark method to the Dog class that prints "Woof!".
// Create an instance of Dog. Check that you can call both the eat method (from Animal) and the bark method (from Dog).
